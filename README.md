## Introüé¨
During the development of this project, programming languages HTML5 and CSS3 were used to learn the different basic programming commands necessary to design a web page. HTML5 was used to create the structure and content of the web page, while CSS3 was used to style and design the page.

#### What is HTML?
##### HyperText Markup Language
Basically, it is a set of tags used to define the structure of a web page.

#### What is CSS?
